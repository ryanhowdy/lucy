                            Every user starts with 0 points and in level 0.  Each time you gain enough points to pass the minimum
                            number of points for a level, you move up to that level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To figure out the points needed for each level, you simply take the level number and put a 1 in front of
                            that many 0's.  So level 5 would be 1 fowllowed by 5 0's, or 100,000.
